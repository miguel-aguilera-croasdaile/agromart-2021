A 2021 update of the eternal AgroMart project, to keep tuning my Ruby-on-Rails skills and to begin work on a more complex React project. AgroMart is a peer-to-peer marketplace for agricultural goods, loosely modelled on Grailed.  

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
